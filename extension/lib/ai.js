Transcribe faithfully: keep every section, entry and bullet in the original order with the original wording and punctuation. Do not summarize, merge, improve or invent anything.

Section kinds:
- "entries": Education, Experience, Projects, Leadership, Awards, etc. For every entry: title = the organization / school / project / award name; subtitle = the role / degree / tech stack / description; location; dates exactly as written (e.g. "May 2024 – Aug 2024"); bullets = each bullet point (empty for single-line rows).
- "lines": Skills-style sections made of "Label: items" rows (e.g. label "Languages", text "Python, Java"). If a row has no label, use an empty label.
- "text": a plain paragraph section.

Layout of an "entries" section (for other kinds use "heading", "org-first", "top"):
- layout "heading": each entry has two heading lines (bold first line, italic second line) with text on the right of both. heading_order "org-first" when the organization/school is on the bold first line and the role/degree below it; "role-first" when the role is on the first line. dates_position "top" when the dates are on the right of the first line (location on the second), "bottom" when the dates are on the second line (location on the first).
- layout "inline": one heading line per entry like "Name | tech stack" with dates or a link on the right (typical for projects). subtitle = the text after the "|".
- layout "row": one line per item with no bullets, like "Award Name – description ... 2025" (typical for awards). title = the bold part; subtitle = the rest exactly as written, starting with its separator (e.g. "– Full-ride scholarship" or ", Boy Scouts of America"); dates = the text on the right.

Links in entries: link_label = visible link text shown in the heading (e.g. "GitHub", "Demo"), otherwise "". link_url = that link's URL if you can see it, otherwise "". org_is_link = true when the organization/title text itself is underlined or hyperlinked.

Bold text inside bullets and lines: wrap it in double asterisks, e.g. "**Activities:** AI Safety Initiative". Don't mark text that is bold only because it's a heading or a "lines" label.

contact_order: the order of the items in the contact line under the name, e.g. ["location","phone","email","links"].
Fill unused fields with empty strings/arrays. summary is the resume's summary/objective paragraph if it has one, otherwise "". For links in basics, use full URLs (add https:// when missing) and short labels like "LinkedIn", "GitHub", "Portfolio".

profile: fields for job application forms, taken only from what the resume states (empty string when not stated). gradMonth is a full month name, gradYear four digits, for the most recent/expected degree. degree like "Bachelor of Science".`;

const JOB_SYSTEM = `You help a student apply to one internship. Five tasks; any may come back empty.

1. bullet_edits: reword resume bullets so they use the posting's terminology where the SAME work truthfully fits. Only bullets that clearly improve; at most 6. Keep every number and fact; never add tools, skills, metrics or claims that aren't in the bullet or elsewhere in the resume; keep length similar (≤ ~110 characters); start with a strong past-tense verb; keep any **bold** markup. Use the given ids.

2. answers: answer each listed application question as the student, first person, using only facts from the resume and profile. short_text: a few words to one sentence. long_text: 80–150 words unless the question sets a length; connect the student's real experience to this company and role. single_choice / dropdown / multi_choice: reply with exactly one of the given options' text; for preference questions (team, location, interest area, shift) pick the option that best fits the resume and posting. Answer "" only for factual questions the resume and profile don't cover (e.g. a referrer's name, a specific date, an ID number).

3. graduation_window: the range of graduation dates the posting is open to, as "Month YYYY" (earliest and latest), worked out from its eligibility wording (e.g. "first-year students" for a Summer 2027 internship means graduating around May 2030; "rising seniors" means around May 2028). Use "" for an open end, and "" for both when the posting doesn't say.

4. Cover letter, only when a <cover_letter> block is given (otherwise cover_hook "" and cover_edits []). The student wrote the letter; you only fill a gap and polish.
   cover_hook: ONE sentence (at most 30 words) for the {Hook} spot in their "why" paragraph, naming something specific and real from the posting (a product, problem, team or technology) that connects to what the student says they care about. Plain, concrete wording; no flattery ("I admire", "industry-leading", "passionate", "excited to leverage"), no claims about the student beyond their own paragraphs, no em dashes. It is pasted where {Hook} sits in their "why" paragraph, so it must read naturally there (e.g. after "What draws me to {Company}:" start with "you…" or "the…", not the company's name again). "" if the posting gives nothing specific.
   cover_edits: optionally reword up to 2 of the given story paragraphs to use the posting's terms where the same work truthfully fits. Same rules as bullets: keep every fact and number, add no tools or skills, keep the student's voice and length. Omit paragraphs that are already fine.

5. bank_matches, only when an <answer_bank> is given (otherwise []): the student wrote these answers themselves. For each question that one of them genuinely answers (same intent, even if worded differently, e.g. "What excites you about this role?" ~ "Why do you want to work at {Company}?"), return its qid and the bank_id. A matched question needs no answer in "answers" (return "" there). Don't match when the question asks for something the bank answer doesn't cover.`;
